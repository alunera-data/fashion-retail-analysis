# Background

The global fashion industry is shaped by growing competition, changing consumer behavior, and increasing data availability.\
Retail store networks are an essential part of most fashion brands, yet their success depends on many factors â€“ such as location, store type, founding year, brand strength, or discount strategies.

This project explores how these characteristics affect store performance using a simulated dataset of over 60,000 global transactions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Research Questions

What factors drive store performance in global fashion retail?

In particular, this analysis investigates:

-   Differences in store performance by country, brand, and founding year
-   Performance variations across store types and categories
-   The impact of discounts on store-level revenue
-   Relationships identifiable through statistical models

The analysis is conducted in **R** using **Quarto**, **ggplot2**, **linear regression**, and **confidence intervals** via `qnorm()` for statistical interpretation.

## Dataset Overview

The project uses a synthetic, but highly realistic dataset simulating global fashion retail operations.\
It includes 6 interrelated CSV files:

-   **transactions.csv** (6.4 million rows): Line-level transactions with price, quantity, discount, product, customer, employee and store reference
-   **customers.csv** (1.6 million): Demographic customer data
-   **products.csv**: Product IDs, categories and multilingual descriptions
-   **stores.csv**: Locations, sizes and geospatial data of stores
-   **employees.csv**: Employee assignments and roles
-   **discounts.csv**: Structured promotional campaign information

All data is loaded locally and not shared in the repository.
